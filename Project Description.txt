We have done the first project which had listed requirements:
Functional requirements:

1. The user will register and log in to the system. The user information will be stored in a database.

2. The program will have a virtual assistant ( an animation of a graphic design) which will help the user throughout the system.

3. The user will be taught to read the analog clock (such as 5 past 10) and the digital clock ( ten-fifteen).

4. The user will be taught to learn the seasons (autumn, fall, summer, spring) with multimedia animations.

5. The user will be taught to count the days of the week sequentially.

6. The user will be taught to count the months of the year sequentially.

7. The user will remember the digits shown on the screen from the beginning to the end.

8. The user will remember the digits shown on the screen in a backward manner.

9. The application will ask the user how to spell/write a word correctly.

10. The application will teach the user the directions (left, right, in front of, at the back etc).

11. The user will be taught how to do multiplication (6 * 7 = 42 ).

12. The user will be asked to find similar pictures on the screen.

13. The user will be shown a ball on the screen. This ball moves on the screen (to the corners, to the next line like in reading) and the user needs to follow this ball on the screen with his eyes.

14. The application needs to have a learning part and a playing part.

15. Each time the user earns a point, positive feedback is given.

16. Their scores and the activities they have accomplished need to be recorded in the database.

Non-functional requirements:

1. Reaching the activities from the main screen should at most take 3 clicks.

2. The response time of the program should be below 1 second.

3. The colors and design on the screen should be suitable for dyslexic kids.

4. MongoDB, Firebase or MySQL db should be used.
